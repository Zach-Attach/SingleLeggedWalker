# Sensorimotor Neural Coupling in Embodied Continuous-Time Recurrent Neural Networks

This code is currently very cluttered, please excuse the mess.

## File Structure
out/ - Output files from the experiments  
out/\<N\>/ - Output files for experiments related to \<N\> neuron networks  
out/\<N\>/behav/ - Recorded Leg Angles  
out/\<N\>/best/ns - Best Phenotypes  
out/\<N\>/best/gen - Best Genotypes  
out/\<N\>/best/fit - Best Fitnesses  
paper/ - LaTeX source code for the paper  
plots/ - Plots generated by the plot code, used by the LaTeX source code  
src/ - Source code 
src/agent/ - code for simulating the agent 
src/analysis/ - code for analysis that is not part of the overall pipeline
src/collate/ - code for collating the data from the experiments
src/plot/ - code for generating plots (very messy)
