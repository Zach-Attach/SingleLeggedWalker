# SingleLeggedWalker

Code for evolving Recurrent Neural Networks to perform minimally cognitive behavior using a Single Legged Walker body. 

The code that simulates the single legged walker was developed by Dr. Randall Beer and is not my own. It has been altered by myself but did not originate from me.
